# Individual Assignment 3

**Due Date: December 1, 2024 at 11:59 PM**

For this assignment, you will assume the role of a cybersecurity professional in an organization that has recently suffered a serious cyberattack and its operations have been compromised. You have also lost control of some personally-identifiable information (PII) has been exfiltrated from the organization.

Your task is to write **two** disclosure notices: one for customers of the organization whose services will be impacted, and one for anyone who the organization believes may have been affected by the PII leak.

See the Content section for more guidance on what is expected in terms of data breached and mitigations.

## Source

**Watch the video** at [this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nl_56YZVFA) on the Omega cyberattack. 

This incident took place during the 1990s. However, you should assume that the circumstances of this attack happened in the present time when crafting your advice and mitigations. Despite nearly three decades of research and real-life experience in cybersecurity, many small businesses still operate on systems very similar to Omega's, that could fall victim to the same type of attack.

## Format

Your disclosures should be in written form, as would be suitable for delivery via printed mail or E-mail. There is no specific length requirement, but you must include all of the required content items. A length of one page would probably be considered average - you want to be concise while still including all relevant information.

## Content

A few items must be included:

* What data was breached (for this example, as we learned the backups themselves were taken out of the organization, we should assume all information the company holds on its customers may have been leaked.)
* The potential impact the data breached may have on those who had their data exfiltrated.

    > Assume that your audience may not be strongly familiar with cybersecurity and the risks that may occur due to a data breach. Provide a very brief explanation of attacks such as identity theft or password reuse attacks (depending on what PII you decide was breached in your scenario).

* A description of how the attack occurred appropriate for the audiences.

    > Refer to the video - describe the situation in an appropriate level of detail for both Omega's direct customers as well as anyone they may have had PII on (employees, customers, visitors, etc.)
    >
    > Omega's direct customers can be assumed to be more sophisticated, so for that disclosure, give specific details as to what happened. For the disclosure going to anyone who's PII was lost, assume those individuals and organizations do not have strong technical knowledge.

* For PII victims, guidance as to what they can do to protect themselves.

* What steps will be taken to mitigate damage, both to the organization *and to those individuals affected*. 

    > Consider a theoretical, but reasonable, offer to users, such as discounted or free credit monitoring or assistance with addressing damage caused by the breach. You should also offer obvious free solutions, such as improving company structure and policies and introducing additional auditing.

## Deliverable

Prepare your disclosure notices in either a Word or a PDF document and submit to the D2L Dropbox.

This is an **individual** assignment. All class members must submit an original, independently created submission.

## Scoring Rubric

This assignment is worth 50 points. Points are assigned as follows:

| Item | Points | Penalties |
|-|-|-|
| Provided information on the specifics of the breach scenario - what data was stolen and how it might impact the victims | 15 | Variable point loss if significant or important details are missing. |
| Provided practical guidance for users who are victims of the breach scenario | 15 | Variable point loss if significant or important details are missing. |
| Provided information on mitigation of negative effects from the attack for both the user (e.g. offers of discounted monitoring) and the organization (e.g. resetting accounts with stolen passwords) | 15 | Variable point loss if poor/incorrect advice given or advice is missing. |
| Document uploaded in correct format (Word or PDF) | 5 | Loss of points if document is not in PDF or Word format. **More or all points may be lost if I can't convert your submission into a readable format!** |

Late submissions will receive a total loss of percentage of earned points based on the syllabus's Late Work policy. **Submissions 3 days late or later will receive 0 points.**
