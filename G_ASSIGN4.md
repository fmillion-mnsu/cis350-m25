# Group Assignment 4

This assignment will give you the opportunity to experience packet sniffing and how it can be used to analyze network traffic and capture information.

> **WARNING**
>
> Even something as simple as a port scan can be considered unauthorized access to a computer system, and if the owner of the system you scan detects the scan, you could face many consequences, including legal liability. 
>
> In this exercise you will be sniffing traffic within virtual machine images that I provide to you. Packet sniffing is a type of reconnaissance, and for the most part is it "legal" to do so, as long as you are running your packet sniffer on systems you own or have permission to run it on - as with many attacks. For this exercise, you will be sniffing traffic on your own system, so there are no ethical or legal issues. However, installing and using Wireshark or similar packet sniffing tools on systems you do *not* own can be illegal. 
> 
> You are completely 100% responsible for your behavior when you practice cybersecurity skills. "I was learning how to sniff traffic" is **absolutely not** a valid excuse or reason for attacking, attempting to gain access to, or otherwise disrupting a computer system you do not own or have permission to attack. 

**For this exercise, you need to download a virtual machine image. The images can be downloaded from D2L**.

## Steps

1. Download the virtual machine image for Group Assignment 4.

1. Start by adding the "Target" virtual machine to your VM environment. See the [Importing VMs for Windows](VM_IMPORT.md#windows) or the [Importing VMs for Mac](VM_IMPORT.md#mac) documents for details on exactly how to add the VM to your environment.

1. If you don't already have one, create a Kali Linux virtual machine by [following these instructions](KALI.md).

1. **VERY IMPORTANT**: You MUST connect your virtual machines to a **Host-Only** network. (Failing to do this will result in significant point loss!) 

   On Windows, go into the VM settings and ensure the network adapter is set to Host-Only.

   ![VMware settings window showing the network set to Host Only](assets/win_hostonly.png)

   On Mac, go into the VM settings and set the network to "Private to my Mac."

1. Start up the Target VM.

    If the VM starts successfully, you should see a screen similar to this:

    ![Screenshot showing target VM with code words and IP](assets/a4_target.png)

    **Take a screenshot of this screen** or otherwise note the code words. You do not need to submit an actual screenshot of the code words as part of your submission (as you will see later), but the four code words on screen *are* required as part of your submission - not including these code words will result in significant loss of points.

1. Now, start up your Kali Linux VM.

    You are now ready to perform your packet sniffing exercise.

    > **Hint:**
    >
    > Depending on your platform, you may find that the default resolution for Kali is quite small (800x600). If so, you may want to raise the resolution of the virtual machine so that you can fit more on the screen, especially if you have a large monitor or a high-resolution display.
    >
    > To do this, choose the Display Settings option.
    >
    > ![low resolution Kali desktop with start menu open and Settings selected](assets/kali_res.png)
    >
    > Set the resolution to a higher value and then apply the settings.

1. Launch Wireshark on the Kali VM. It is found under the menu "09 Sniffing and Spoofing".

    ![Start menu of Kali showing WireShark under section 9](assets/wshark_01.png)

1. Also, open a Terminal window. It's the small square icon on the top bar.

    ![Picture of the Terminal icon](assets/wshark_02.png)

1. Start a packet capture in Wireshark. To do this quickly, just double-click the line that says "eth0". The Wireshark application should switch into a list view showing the captured packets.

    > You may see a random packet here and there, as the network layer in the Kali VM does things like probe the network for available routers. 

1. In the terminal, **ping the IP address of your target VM.** The IP address is displayed on the target's screen.

    Remember, the command for pinging is `ping <IP_address>`, **replacing `<IP_address>` with the IP address of the target VM.**

1. Take a look at the Wireshark window and notice the packets that were sent from your Kali VM to the target VM. You should see packets with the source as the IP of your Kali box and the destination as the target IP, with each packet immediately followed by a packet showing the reverse (source is target, destination is Kali). 

    ![Example screenshot of ping capture](assets/wshark_03.png)

    **Take a screenshot of Wireshark** showing this. You can do this from outside the VM.

    **Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop the ping operation.**

1. Now, open the Firefox browser. You'll see it on the top bar right next to the terminal icon.

1. Restart the capture to clear the Wireshark packet capture log. Under the Capture menu, choose Restart and choose not to save the capture log.

1. Now, in your browser window, visit the URL `http://<target_IP>`, again **replacing `<target_IP>` with the IP address of the target.** For example, if your target IP is `172.17.2.2`, you'd visit `http://172.17.2.2`. 

    Make sure you include the `http://` part of the address. If you put in only the IP address, Firefox will try to make a secure connection first. We're going to do that shortly, but first we want to see an *unencrypted* transmission so that we can view the packet log.

1. The browser should show the simple web page, and you should see some packets in the Wireshark window.

    ![Example of packet capture after viewing web page](assets/wshark_04.png)

1. If you look in the packet list, you'll see some packets with the Protocol column labeled `HTTP`. These packets represent the actual connections your browser made to the target VM!

    Look for a packet where the Info field shows that it is a `GET` request for `/` - that is, the Info field should read `GET / HTTP/1.1`. You may need to scroll the packet list up and down a bit to find it. The packet should have the source IP of your Kali VM and the destination IP of the target VM.

    Immediately or very closely below this packet, you should also see a response packet that has an Info field reading `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`. It may occur a few packets down. **Click on this packet.**

    Now, in the bottom half of the Wireshark window, you'll be able to see the raw packet data as well as an analysis of the packet's contents. In this example, we can see that the packet is an Ethernet packet, transmitted using IP version 4, with TCP, coming from port 80 of the web server. The packet contains HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) data. And if you scroll right a bit, you'll be able to see the *actual* raw data of the packet.

    If you know any HTML, you'll see some in here! 

    ![Example of viewing packet details](assets/wshark_05.png)

1. Now, *right click* on the packet you already selected, and choose Follow -> HTTP Stream.

    This option is the packet stream analysis option we talked about. This option tells Wireshark to analyze the entire sequence of packets that make up this HTTP connection.

    ![Pointing out the option to view the HTTP stream](assets/wshark_06.png)

1. You should see a screen similar to the one shown below. Notice that this screen presents the data of the HTTP transmission a lot more cleanly. Here you can actually see both the HTTP protocol messages themselves (colored in red) and the actual HTTP payload data, in this case the HTML page (colored in blue).

    ![Example of packet stream view](assets/wshark_07.png)

1. **Look within the HTML data for a section that looks like this: `<!--debug: SomeRandomCharactersHere-->`**. Note that `SomeRandomCharactersHere` will actaully be a set of random characters. **Highlight these characters and then take a screenshot**, as shown in the example above.

    These characters are an encrypted, encoded string that is cryptographically based on your code words.

    **Repeat steps 12-19 a total of four times - see notes below.**

1. Close the window and go back to the packet capture window, and restart the capture to clear the view. 

1. Finally, we're going to do an HTTPS connection to the same server. In Firefox, visit `https://<target_IP>`. Firefox will warn you of an unverifiable SSL connection - this is fine because we are in a lab and testing environment, so you should choose to proceed anyway.

1. Now, look at Wireshark. You'll notice that instead of HTTP packets, we see `TLSv1.3` packets. TLS is the modern name for SSL, which is a protocol for sending encrypted data across the Internet. 

    SSL uses the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol to select and share a random symmetric key to use for an individual session. The DH exchange is designed in such a way that an eavesdropper cannot figure out that symmetric key even if it sees both ends of the negotiation phase. (Neat, huh?)

    If you select one of the TLS packets, you'll see that all of the data is encrypted and nonsensical:

    ![Packet capture showing encrypted TLSv1.3 data](assets/wshark_08.png)

    We're no longer able to see the code words in the packet capture because this connection was encrypted using TLS - a process we discussed earlier in this course.

1. For the assignment, you will need one run of unencrypted HTTP packet sniffing (steps 12-19) **per group member**. **Restart** the target VM between each run and note the new code words each time before accessing the web page and running the packet sniff.

    More details on actual submission are below.

## What We Learned

Packet sniffing is a powerful technique for analyzing the behavior of applications and the content of data they send across a network. Packet sniffing on its own is generally not considered an "attack" but would be more of a reconnaissance or enumeration task (depending on context). 

We saw that, with unencrypted standard HTTP (which was actually the norm until about a decade ago), it is possible to actually view the unencrypted contents of web communication.

Packet sniffing on your own computer, like we did here, is useful as a research tool. However, in an *attack* scenario, a hacker might use packet sniffing to try to *eavesdrop* or *intercept* traffic traversing a network. There are a few ways this can be accomplished, but as we can see, sending unencrypted data over the Internet is *dangerous* if there is any chance of the data being sniffed.

> It isn't always malicious actors who might be interested in packet sniffing. ISPs have been known to use sniffing as well as active packet modification to determine the type of content you are viewing and inject relevant advertisements into web pages that don't already contain them!
>
> Businesses also often use packet sniffing to detect unknown or misbehaving devices on their network, and historically also to monitor and control the types of content being accessed.

Today, nearly all Web traffic is transmitted using `https`, which as you see cannot be easily deciphered. Theoretical attacks do exist for TLS, but they require an enormous amount of computing power (and even then are not guaranteed to be successful). The shift to `https` was fueled very strongly by increasing awareness of packet sniffing and the potential risks it has.

> Businesses will use a *proxy server* on their network in order to continue to be able to monitor content. This requires special configuration on the clients accessing the Internet, so companies will often apply those configurations to company-owned computers. In practice, this is essentially a permitted and sanctioned man-in-the-middle attack.
>
> It is perfectly legal for a company to sniff traffic on its own network for any purpose it desires. Therefore, a very strong piece of advice is to **never do anything on a company-owned computer that you would not want that company knowing about**. You are not guaranteed any privacy on a company network.
>
> Similarly, it **is** legal to sniff traffic on your own personally-owned home network, so you may wish to install Wireshark on your own computer outside the VM to experiment. You are free to sniff the activity of any software you are running on your computer (although since so much communication is secure these days, packet sniffing has become more of a diagnostic tool, to verify active communication between endpoints, and less of an actual data harvesting strategy). You *should not* packet sniff on networks you don't own, such as the MSU campus network, public guest networks, networks at friends' houses, etc. Also, please practice ethical behavior and don't use packet sniffing to attack friends or family who may be connecting to your network when visiting!

## Submission

Your submission must include the following components:

* ***One*** screenshot of Wireshark showing packets indicating a successful ping and response from the target VM.
* ***One*** screenshot showing an *encrypted* `HTTPS` (TLSv1.3) transmission.
* ***One*** screenshot ***per group member***, along with accompanying *code words* as printed on the target VM's display, that clearly show the `<!--debug: RandomString-->` text from the packet capture. Use the Follow->HTTP Stream option to display the page and highlight the above string, *starting at the `<!--` and ending after the `-->`. See the example above.

For convenience, you can name your screenshots with the code words they represent - for example `my code words here.jpg`. If you do not do this, you will need to include a document indicating which screenshot file matches with which code words. (You do not need to do this for the ping or HTTPS screenshots!)

This assignment will be due **Friday, June 20th** at **11:59 PM**.
