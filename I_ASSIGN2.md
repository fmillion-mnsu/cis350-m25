# CIS 350 - Student Presentation Assignment

**Due Date: June 17, 2024 at 11:59 PM**

One of my main goals for you in this course is to come away with an increased awareness and appreciation for not only the methods and techniques used by both bad actors and cybersecurity professionals, but also how cybersecurity impacts everyone every day. The Presentation assignment gives you a chance to explore a current event, issue or technical topic in cybersecurity and present your findings to your classmates. 

Each student in this course will deliver one (1) presentation. **You will deliver your presentation on the final day of synchronous course meetings on June 17th**.

## Presentation Requirements

* Your presentation should be a **minimum** of 6 minutes in length, and **no more** than 10 minutes in length. I will interrupt and cut off presentations that exceed 11 minutes due to time constraints.
* You may format your presentation in any way you feel appropriate and comfortable with. If applicable you may include live demonstrations or short clips of videos. You are not required to use PowerPoint if you prefer a different presentation tool, as long as you can present it to the class via Zoom.
* Your presentation's contents will partly depend on your specific topic, but in general all presentations must include the following:
  * A brief concise introduction to your topic
  * Technical details as necessary for others in class to understand your topic
  * Practical implications - both technical and non-technical. Again, this will vary depending on your topic - for example, if you are presenting on a recent breach, specific advice based on that breach's circumstances would be appropriate; if you are presenting on a technical topic such as a specific attack method or research area, advice to users on mitigation of any threat is appropriate. You will often need to synthesize this advice on your own!
  * A final slide for allowing the class to ask you questions

## Topics

You may be wondering exactly what is acceptable as a topic. In general, a topic should be specific but not so specific that there is very little to say on it.

Large events, such as the CrowdStrike incident, can make up multiple presentations - one might include a technical breakdown as to exactly what happened and advice for software developers, while another might explore how the breach impacted large corporations and advice for those corporations to prevent or minimize impact from a similar event, while still another might include a discussion on how the incident affected everyday individuals and what advice might help individuals deal with the fallout of the incident.

Please strive to avoid "low-hanging fruit" such as "another routine data breach". If you are going to cover a data breach, try to find one that has a particularly unique or interesting aspect to it. For example, a data breach based on a simple phishing attack would be "low-hanging fruit" since these breaches are unfortunately quite common. However, a breach that involved an especially novel or clever method of infiltration would be appropriate, especially since you may be able to give some unique advice to both organizations and individuals.

You may also choose to cover a technical topic, such as research into a novel way of attacking or infiltrating a secure system or network. In this case, the advice section should include a discussion on how the attack strategy might be used to attack a person and what a person might be able to do to try to mitigate or minimize negative impact.

There is always a ton of interesting developments happening in cybersecurity, so I do not anticipate you'll have trouble finding a unique topic, However, if you are completely stuck and unsure of a topic, please contact me and I'll give you some ideas.

## Submissions

By **June 5th, 2025**, please submit your **chosen topic** and **one web link or other resource you will use** on D2L in the "Presentation Topic" dropbox.

You will also submit your presentation itself - any materials you use (e.g. PowerPoint, link to online presentation, visual aids, links to videos, etc.) must be submitted to the main "Final Presentation" dropbox on D2L **prior to 11:15 AM on June 17th**.

## Scoring Rubric

This project is worth 150 points.

| Item | Points | Penalties |
|-|-|-|
| Presentation includes detailed information on a recent,, current cybersecurity topic (generally less than 3 months old, exceptions may be made for especially important events) | 60 | Variable point loss depending on adherence to requirement. |
| Technical content is accurate and well researched. | 30 | 4 points lost per vulnerability without strategies for mitigation. Minimum score for this item is 0. |
| Presentation includes actionable or useful advice for everyone or for specific audiences and types of people | 30 | Variable point loss depending on adherence to requirement. |
| Presentation is well designed with correct spelling, grammar, appropriate language and good form. Appropriate use of visual aids if applicable | 20 | Point loss depends on severity of errors. |
| Verbal delivery of presentation was clear and professional | 10 | Obvious evidence of poor preparation will result in loss of points.
